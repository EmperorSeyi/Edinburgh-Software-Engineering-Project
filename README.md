# Edinburgh-Software-Engineering-Project
This project is essentially a collaborative storytelling platform for building shared worlds, characters, and timelines. Given the fixed time and budget constraints of a single-semester academic project, the team intentionally focused on delivering a small, high-quality MVP prototype rather than a complete production system.
