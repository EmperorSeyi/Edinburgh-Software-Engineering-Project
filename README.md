# 🌍 Creative Transformation Support (CTS) — Software Development Project

**Programme:** University of Edinburgh — MSc Data Science, Technology & Innovation  
**Course:** Software Development (2025–2026)  
**Team:** Olivia Heale · Gabriele Dalla Torre · Kangsu Lee · Oluseyi Olaniyi · Cathy Xia  
**Client:** Creative Transformation Support (CTS)

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the **Scotch Broth**
software development project, delivered for Creative Transformation Support (CTS).

The long-term product vision is a **collaborative storytelling platform** for building
shared worlds, characters, and timelines.

Given the fixed time and budget constraints of a single-semester academic project,
the team intentionally focused on delivering a **small, high-quality MVP prototype**
rather than a complete production system.

---

## 🎯 MVP Scope

The implemented MVP demonstrates a focused **narrative engine for character
development over timelines**.

The prototype supports:

- Creating characters  
- Creating events  
- Applying attribute changes over time  
- Computing character state at any point in the timeline  
- Exporting a static HTML summary for review  

The MVP is implemented as a **Python-based CLI application**, with persistence via
MongoDB and full environment reproducibility using Docker.

## 🟢 Start Here (for assessors and reviewers)

If you are reviewing this project for assessment, we recommend the following reading order:

1. [`README.md`](README.md) — overall context, scope, and navigation  
2. [`docs/design/mvp/mvp-requirements.md`](docs/design/mvp/mvp-requirements.md) — what was built and why  
3. [`docs/design/mvp/prototype-architecture-overview.md`](docs/design/mvp/prototype-architecture-overview.md) — how the MVP works  
4. [`docs/software/technology-exploration.md`](docs/software/technology-exploration.md) — technologies considered and rationale  
5. [`docs/final-evaluation-report.md`](docs/final-evaluation-report.md) — evaluation of the prototype and project  

---

## ▶️ Running and Using the Prototype

All user-facing setup and usage instructions are provided in a **single consolidated user guide**:

- [`docs/user-guide.md`](docs/user-guide.md)

This guide covers:
- prerequisites and installation
- environment setup
- running the CLI prototype
- example commands and expected outputs

As this is a prototype, usability is evaluated in terms of **clarity, conceptual flow,
and learnability**, rather than interface polish.

## 🔁 CI / CD

This repository uses **GitLab CI** to automatically run unit tests on commit.

The pipeline configuration is defined in:

- [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml)

This ensures the prototype remains stable and testable throughout development.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

The project follows a **dual-track design approach**:

- **Build now:** deliver a working, testable MVP that validates core logic  
- **Design forward:** document how the system could evolve into a full product  

Future-facing UX and architecture materials are intentionally separated to keep
the MVP clearly scoped and assessable.
